# ISSUES:

# middle_score method: how do I define scenario? What about when @moves is empty?
# recursive method - is this doing what I think it's doing?
# TESTS!!!!
# Refactor in multiple classes
# winner method: do I need @win to pass back who won?
# winner method: do I need both @win and @score??
# play_game method: can this be improved?
# ComputerPlayer doesn't have a name
# Refactor x && y && part of if statement - big if/else and mini inside
