  # ISSUES:

# MINIMAX: recursive method - is this doing what I think it's doing?
# middle_score method: how do I define scenario? What about when @moves is empty?
# HELP WITH TESTS!!!!
# private: easier way than putting private before every method?
# play_game method: can this be improved?
# winner method: do I need @win to pass back who won?
# winner method: do I need both @win and @score??
# ComputerPlayer doesn't have a name
#Refactor x && y && part of if statement - big if/else and mini inside
